# Client Engineer Game Development Coding Assignment

## General rules
- Technologies to use: Pixi.js, TweenMax, JS
- No external framework should be used
- Use git to document how your code is evolving

## Project initial run
  ```bash
  npm i
  npm start
  ```

## Deliverable

A revised jumping game that includes at least one additional animation element and a leaderboard of top 10 scores. 


## Game Specification

### The purpose of this assignment

The purpose of the assignment is to show off your skills, both in terms of how you solve a problem and how you structure code within the existing codebase. Additionally, you can demonstrate your eye for visual design (layout, animations).

The main focus of this assignment is to check your ability to write clean, well-structured and reusable code.

### Create one additional animation

You will create a simple animation that can be used once the player reaches the top of the leaderboard. You can use any available resources on the web.

### Create a leaderboard

Create a leaderboard using any layout you would like. Within the leaderboard, have a list of 10 ficticious players with their scores. As the current player's score increases, have them move upward within the leaderboard. Show an animation when they top the leaderboard.

### Bonus assignment (optional)

Create bonus diamonds worth 10 points. Animate the bonus diamonds so players can distinguish them from the standard diamonds.

### Deploy game

Build and deploy game to any environment that will allow it to be reviewed. GitHub is a fine option.

## Project build
  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
This command creates the build for production and saves the created build's files in the dist/ folder.
